	  <![CDATA[<p>Jackie Canterbury talks with Dr. Steve Hampton from the local Rainshadow Bird Alliance, formerly Admiralty Audubon, about the oldest citizen science program of its kind, the Audubon Christmas Bird Count or CBC. The CBC began on Christmas Day 1900 as a way to count birds rather than shoot them as people began to become visibly concerned about declining bird populations. The Port Townsend CBC occurs on December 14, relying on volunteer birders and encompassing much of the Quimper Peninsula. The Rainshadow Alliance administers our local CBC and submits data to National Audubon where Audubon and other organizations use the data to guide conservation efforts for birds, including the greatest challenge of all, climate change. "There is nothing else like the CBC in terms of geographic coverage and time," says Geoff LaBaron of National Audubon. And none of it would happen without dedicated volunteers.

	  <description>
	  <![CDATA[<p>We're all familiar with Washington's state flower, the native Pacific Rhododendron. Did you know there is a classification for that ecosystem – it's called the Rhododendron forest. Remnants of the Rhododendron forest are on the Toandos Peninsula in Puget Sound and are technically part of a "globally imperiled plant association". This forest type has been confirmed by botanists with the Department of Natural Resources' Natural Heritage Program. Over the past decade biologists have mapped this globally rare type of forest which represents the largest occurrence of its type left in the world. Although this native forest type was once common west of the Cascades in Washington state, it has largely been eliminated by conversion to tree plantations and development. Join Jackie Canterbury as she talks with Peter Bahls, Director and Biologist for the Northwest Watershed Institute, and Heidi Eisenhour, Jefferson County Commissioner, about their collaborative efforts to protect this globally rare remaining Pacific Rhododendron forest.

The park encompasses 496 acres of land with a diversity of plant communities, wetlands, and forests. The park bears the family name of an earlier owner, Amanda Anderson. The land was purchased in 1947. The park now offers trails that pass along the lake and through grassy marshes, patches of salmonberries and huckleberries and through forests of young and older western red cedar and Douglas-fir.

	  <![CDATA[<p>Jackie Canterbury talks with Dr. Steve Hampton about the oldest citizen science program of its kind, the Audubon Christmas Bird Count or CBC. The CBC began on Christmas Day 1900 as a way to count birds rather than shoot them as people began to become visibly concerned about declining bird populations. Today the CBC occurs each year from December 14 through January 5 relying on volunteer birders. Audubon and other organizations use the 122 years of data to guide conservation efforts, including the greatest challenge of all, climate change. "There is nothing else like the CBC in terms of geographic coverage and time," says Geoff LeBaron, Christmas Bird Count Director for the National Audubon Society. And none of it would happen without dedicated volunteers.
