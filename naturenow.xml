	  <![CDATA[<p>Jackie Canterbury talks with Dr. Steve Hampton about the plight of the Caspian Tern colony on Rat Island near Flagler campground on Marrowstone Island. Hampton discusses the events of 2022 and 2023 that led to an 80% loss of the breeding colony due to human disturbance and an avian flu outbreak. If we understand the historical perspective of the Caspian Tern dilemma, perhaps humans and the agencies responsible for the management of Rat Island can make 2024 less painful (part 2 of two programs on this topic).

The outbreak is the first H5N1 avian flu event in the marine environment in Washington state.  We are estimating an 80% colony loss on Rat island which hosts breeding Caspian Terns, Olympic Gulls, and Harbor Seals (part 1 of two programs on this topic).
